### What They're Doing Right

### What They're Doing Wrong
1. **Limited Geographic Targeting**: Only mentions "Columbia, SC" and "Greater Columbia, Lexington, and the Midlands" - not targeting specific neighborhoods/municipalities
2. **No Location-Specific Pages**: Missing individual pages for Cayce, Forest Acres, Blythewood, etc.
3. **Generic Content**: Homepage content is generic, not optimized for local search
4. **Missing Long-Tail Keywords**: Not targeting specific searches like "HVAC repair in Irmo" or "plumber in Dentsville"
5. **No Service Area Page**: Doesn't list all communities they serve
6. **Limited Schema Markup**: Likely missing local business schema for each service area
7. **No FAQ Section**: Missing opportunity for long-tail keyword targeting
8. **Heavy Navigation**: Too many menu items can overwhelm users

### Missing Keywords
- Location-specific: "HVAC Columbia SC", "plumber Lexington SC", "electrician near me"
- Service + Location: "AC repair Cayce", "furnace installation Forest Acres", "emergency plumber Irmo"
- Long-tail: "24 hour HVAC service Columbia", "same day plumber Richland County", "affordable AC repair near me"
- Neighborhood-specific: "HVAC Dentsville", "plumber St. Andrews", "AC repair Hopkins"
- Commercial-specific: "commercial HVAC Columbia", "restaurant plumbing services"
- Emergency: "emergency HVAC repair", "burst pipe repair Columbia"

### Page Title Analysis
**Current**: "Trusted HVAC, Generator, & Plumbing Solutions | 2nd Wind HVAC"
**Issues**: Generic, doesn't include location in primary position, missing key service terms
