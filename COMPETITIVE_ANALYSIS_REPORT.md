---

## 🔴 What Competitors Are Doing WRONG

### 1. **Missing Location-Specific Pages (Critical Weakness - 100% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- **Every single competitor** either has NO location pages for individual towns/neighborhoods, or has broken/generic ones
- They target only "Columbia, SC" broadly, missing 38+ specific Richland County locations
- Examples:
  - **2nd Wind HVAC**: No pages for Irmo, Cayce, Forest Acres, etc.
  - **Midland Air**: Lists 19 service areas but ALL location pages return 404 errors
  - **Carolina Comfort**: Has empty links (`href=""`) for all service area towns
  - **Solutions HVAC**: Location pages return 404 errors

**Why This Matters:**
- People search for "HVAC repair Irmo SC" not just "HVAC repair Columbia"
- Each location page = 20-50 additional keyword rankings
- 38 locations × 3 services = 114 ranking opportunities competitors are MISSING

### 2. **Generic, Non-Localized Content (90% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- Homepage content is boilerplate, could apply to any city
- No mention of local landmarks, neighborhoods, or community-specific needs
- Missing phrases like "serving Dentsville," "Hopkins residents trust us," etc.

**Examples:**
- **Cool Care HVAC**: Generic "we serve Columbia" - no neighborhood mentions
- **Call Dad**: Boilerplate service descriptions with no local context
- **ARS**: Corporate template with zero local personality

### 3. **Poor Title Tags & Missing Meta Descriptions (70% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- **Solutions HVAC**: Title is "Solutions Heating & Air, LLC – Solutions Heating & Air, LLC" (repetitive, unoptimized)
- **Call Dad**: Missing meta description entirely
- **Sunrise Electric**: Missing meta description
- **Most others**: Titles don't include all services or key locations

**What They Should Be:**
- ✅ "HVAC, Plumbing & Electrical | Richland County SC | [Brand]"
- ✅ Meta: "24/7 emergency service in Columbia, Irmo, Cayce, Forest Acres. Licensed technicians. Same-day appointments."

### 4. **Single-Service Focus (40% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- **Rytec Electric**: Only electrical (missing HVAC/plumbing keywords)
- **Sunrise Electric**: Only electrical
- **Many HVAC companies**: Don't mention plumbing or electrical

**Opportunity:**
- Multi-service businesses capture 3x more search traffic
- Someone searching "plumber Irmo" won't find electrical-only companies

### 5. **No Service Area Pages or Broken Links (80% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- **Midland Air**: 404 errors on all location pages
- **Solutions HVAC**: Broken Irmo, SC page
- **Cool Care**: Service areas link returns 404
- **Carolina Comfort**: Empty href links for all towns

**Impact:**
- Lost SEO value from location-specific content
- Poor user experience = high bounce rates
- Google penalizes sites with broken links

### 6. **Missing Long-Tail Keywords (100% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- No one targets specific problems: "AC not cooling Columbia SC," "burst pipe repair Irmo"
- No emergency keywords: "24 hour plumber Richland County"
- No brand-specific: "Carrier AC repair Columbia"
- No commercial: "restaurant HVAC service Columbia"

### 7. **Weak Schema Markup & Technical SEO (85% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- Missing LocalBusiness schema for each service area
- No Service schema for individual services
- Poor internal linking structure
- Slow page load times

### 8. **No FAQ Sections (95% of Competitors)**

**The Problem:**
- FAQs are perfect for long-tail keywords
- "How much does AC repair cost in Columbia?"
- "Do I need a permit for electrical work in Richland County?"
- Competitors are missing this easy SEO win
